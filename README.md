# LITG-Technical-Test

This is a simple technical test showcasing a character that is able to move around, pickup some weapons and shoot them. 
The project uses the newest Unity's Input Action System, and Cinemachine for the cameras transitions.

Here's a small video of one of the weapons projectiles:
